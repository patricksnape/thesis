We presented an optical flow method that incorporates a dense
basis of facial shape. We evaluated our method on a ground truth motion capture
sequence and demonstrated that our proposed algorithm, Face Flow, outperforms
other state-of-the-art optical flow methods. In particular, the introduction
of a low-rank constraint yields a robust multi-frame optical flow technique.
As future work, we intend to investigate a more complex dataset that would enable
Face Flow to model out-of-plane rotations.

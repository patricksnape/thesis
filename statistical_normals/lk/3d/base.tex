\subsection{3D Lucas-Kanade Alignment of Volumetric Data}\label{subsec:singl_img_lk_3d}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Little work has been published on the applications of 3D Lucas-Kanade (LK),
despite the extension of LK into 3D being trivial~\cite{RefWorks:75}. Given the
relative efficiency of Lucas-Kanade and other similar algorithms, and their
potential accuracy under challenging conditions, we propose to investigate using
LK for robust affine alignment in voxel images. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first such comparison of using state-of-the-art LK fitting
algorithms for voxel data. Given the similarity measures defined in
\cref{sec:cosine_normalised_gradients}, we propose novel LK algorithms
that directly maximise the measures.

First and foremost my thanks go to Dr.\ Stefanos Zafeiriou for his support
and guidance throughout the duration of my PhD --- in both my academic and 
personal life. My thanks also go to those who provided academic support
including Professor Maja Pantic, Professor Daniel Reuckert and my examiners
Dr.\ Ben Glocker and Dr.\ Will Smith. I'm sincere when I say that I would never
have gotten through my PhD without the support and team building of those
involved in the Menpo project: James Booth, Nontas Antonakos, 
Joan Alabort-i-Medina, George Trigeorgis, Greg Chrysos and everyone else who 
contributed. My thanks go out to all of my family for their support
over my entire academic career: particularly to my father for his unwavering support
and to my mother for her sage advice: 
``Education is something that noone can ever take away from you.''.
Finally, thank you to Fran for providing my emotional support throughout
these years.

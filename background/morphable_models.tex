\cite{atick1996statistical} proposed one of the earliest analysis-by-synthesis
methods for facial shape recovery. They compute PCA on a set of 
Cyberware~\cite{cyberware} scanned heads they are parametrized using
cylindrical coordinates. They then pose shape recovery as the problem
of recovering the PCA coefficients for a given input image by minimizing
the least squares error between the basis rendered orthographically
using a Lambertian BRDF (with assumed known light and uniform albedo) 
and the input image. This work was inspired by the Eigenfaces work of 
\citet{Sirovich:1987te} but utilized 3D data rather than images. To solve
the least squares a linearisation is performed via a Taylor series expansion
and conjugate gradient descent is applied.

In this background section we have outlined both the history and state-of-the-art
methods for recovering dense facial surfaces from images and videos. Although
this is a widely studied area with many methods providing impressive results,
it is still yet to be considered a solved problem. The most challenging scenario,
recovering shape from challenging ``in-the-wild'' data, is still
a very complex issue within Computer Vision. Therefore, we work to extend
this area in the following chapters in order to shed further light on the
applicability of both shading and alignment based methods for recovering
dense 3D facial shape.

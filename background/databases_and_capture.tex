\section{Databases And Capture Methods}\label{ch:bg_db_capture}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In contrast to generic shape recovery, facial shape recovery implies a strong
assumption that the input image contains a face. This prior knowledge, that the
image contains a face, enables the use of training data to improve the
quality of the reconstruction. The capture and collection of this training data
was historically a complicated endeavour and until recently there were few
publicly available 3D facial databases. However, with the introduction of 
commercial systems such as \citet{3dmd} and \citet{di4d}, the capturing
of this data has become more prevalent for research purposes. For example,
\cref{tbl:timeline_db} provides a timeline outlining when popular 3D facial
databases were released. It is particularly interesting to note that, despite
the fact that one of the first 3D facial models was released in 1987 
(CANDIDE~\cite{Rydfalk:1987tg}), the majority of existing databases were 
produced in the last decade.

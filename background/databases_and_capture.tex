\section{Databases And Capture Methods}\label{ch:bg_db_capture}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In contrast to generic shape recovery, facial shape recovery implies a strong
assumption that the input image contains a face. This prior knowledge that the
image contains a face enables the use of training data to improve the
quality of the reconstruction.
